I'd really like this idea to go through and become mainstream. 

I bet its going to be difficult to build something that makes everyone happy. I think the best is  to start by simple draft implementation and continue iterating by the people that come to the working groups, the feedback is always good, but i think a workin group makes more sense for this. VS everyone giving its point.
Working sessions are very structured right and should have concrete objectives, that way u organize things and don't waste too much time.

I have not checked in super depth but from my point it looks very good. Something I'd try though is getting rid of the extract methods, typescript inference is pretty nice nowadays and don't think we need it.

just like
const schema: Schema<typeof userSchema> = {}  would work as is and inference would work",,,,,,,,,,,Twitter Web App

Which means even if you lose your key, you can actually rotate it and get a new one. It ties to Identity systems so if someone steals your key they can’t use it. Here is a little summary below, but my understanding, is it gained huge respect in the Identity world because it’s solved a majorly complicated problem about looking after keys?

GPT: Yes, that's correct. KERI can be integrated with various identity systems to enhance the security of key management. KERI ensures that the keys are securely managed and can be revoked or rotated if needed, while the identity system handles access to these keys. Here's a summary:

KERI + Identity Systems = Robust Security 🔐✨

KERI is a powerful key management tool that can be integrated with any identity system. It ensures your keys are secure and can be revoked or rotated if compromised. The identity system controls access, while KERI protects the keys. Perfect for safeguarding digital identities!

I know of one Blokchain that’s looking to integrate it. It’s called Cardano. 👀",,,,,,,,,,,Twitter for iPhone

These Trust Anchors are used in coordination with open w3c standards for verifiable credentials & identity. Cryptographic verification of DID’s that’s held in users account on underlying blockchain acts as golden source of truth. 

This has been tested in project guardian by SBI and is what will allow Institutions and their customers and crypto native users to verify their identity and credentials in a seamless, privacy focused, cryptographic secure manner to access regulated financial products and assets on public blockchains.  

I know it’s usually thought of that the public layer 1 blockchain networks are the TRUST LAYER and they are but in a different way, they serve an absolutely critical purpose as being the Golden Source of Truth. All private data is kept off chain but by verifying the DID on-chain the user can be verified for the compliance data required, users are in full control of their credentials and identity and this can be integrated with different Zero knowledge proof systems or homomorphic encryption to add additional privacy layer. Users can rotate their DID’s and create new ones as they please but they will have to choose one Trusted entity to custody their credentials and identity and Users can choose who they want for different reasons. Bc they are THE TRUSTED ENTITY THAT HAS INITIALLY VERIFIED ALL YOUR CREDENTIALS AND IDENTITY. They might be a dedicated ID Firm like #FractalID or some entity who already has verified your identity and credentials like your bank or broker or exchange or whoever.

Problem in creating a TRUST LAYER OF TRUST ANCHORS IS THAT THERES NOT A PROFIT MOTIVATING REASON FOR IT TO NATURALLY DEVELOP AND IT COSTS MONEY TO BUILD AND IMPLEMENT THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND GET BUYIN ACROSS ENOUGH ENTITIES BUT THERE HAS NOT BEEN MUCH OF A REASON TO DO SO UNTIL INSTITUTIONAL DEFI AND RWA tokenization have begun to gain adoption on public blockchains

Ripple’s been tight lipped about this but I think this is something David Schwartz and Ripple have talked about since 2014/2015 and even wrote to w3c saying they were building a distributed identity solution. That was right around time they got fined by FINCEN and the settlement was draconian in that it required ripple to run surveillance and submit reports for multiple years to FINCEN and Treasury dept that is why they did a huge pivot to focus on building out ripplenet that was enterprise only and off the XRPL

BUT NOW EVERYTHING THEY ARE DOING IS TO BUILD THEIR PRIDUCTS AND SERVICES TO PLUG INTO XRPL AND INTEGRATE INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR CUSTOMERS ON-LEDGER TO create an institutional DeFi ecosystem which they claim was always their goal but it was to early and now they have first mover advantage to capture the ULTIMATE PRIZE 🏆—> DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE FUTURE FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND THE NEW FINANCIAL MARKETS THEY CALL INTERNET OF VALUE. Underpinned by the XRPL and its core protocols

Hope that makes sense😉
I’ve been literally studying this for past 5 years and read everything that they have ever put out and watched every interview and presentation but it’s the recent updates that everyone has to be focused on and not banks using XRP in ODL, NOT XRP ETF, NOT RIPPLE IPO AND NOT WILD SPECULATIVE PRICE PREDICTIONS BASED ON NOTHING OR OUTDATED NARRATIVES 

ITS A PUBLIC PERMISSION LEES IMMUTABLE CENSORSHIP RESISTANT DECENTRALIZED DISTRIBUTED NETWORK ACCESSIBLE TO ALL AND BANKS WILL ABSOLUTELY NOT COME TAKE OVER CRYPTO. I can’t believe I just heard that in a video and it totally ignored all the things actually happening and instead speculated on theoretical things

IMHO that type of stuff needs to be respectfully debated and people should be able to make counter points and back them up with facts that debunk theories

Verifiable Credentials (VC) are cryptographically protected digital documents that securely authenticate identity, qualifications, and rights. Built on standards like the W3C's VC Data Model, they ensure privacy, security, and trust in digital interactions.

How it can be used:
- Identity Verification: Replace traditional methods (usernames/passwords) to enhance security and reduce fraud.
- Credential Verification: Streamline verification of qualifications (diplomas, certifications) in hiring and education.
- Access Control: Improve security for accessing sensitive information (healthcare records, financial transactions).
- User Consent Management: Simplify consent verification in data sharing, ensuring compliance and transparency.
- E-commerce Trust: Enhance trust between buyers and sellers by verifying seller credentials or product authenticity.

Verifiable Credentials are setting standards for a more trustworthy digital ecosystem, bridging identity, trust, and security. Explore VC for a safer, more reliable experience! 🛡️💻

Earlier this week we saw IOTA launch an official Digital Product Passport (DPP) prototype for the EU.

This has been a long time coming since 2021.

Initially IOTA was building Digital ID solutions for the EU's testing program under the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) program.

More specifically, we saw IOTA selected to the EBSI's Pre Commercial Procurement (PCP).

This began in 2021 with the initial Phase I.

Since then over the past couple years we'd seen IOTA advance from Phase I all the way to the final Phase II B.

Phase II B ended in Q3-Q4 last year.

The conclusion was that IOTA's solution alongside their partners had come to a success for Digital IDs!

After that things went kinda quiet with the EU for a bit & some were thinking if this was the end of the road for the past few years of IOTA x EU.

Then suddenly out of nowhere in June 2024... We saw IOTA added to the EU's Blockchain Sandbox.

This sandbox builds on top of all the PCP innovations in EBSI plus many other use case concepts!

Now IOTA & their partners now spearheads the Digital ID initiative within the EU Sandbox.

On the other hand, it does appear that there'll be some overlap in utility with $CHEQ which is also another Digital ID project in the Sandbox.

While IOTA builds the Digital ID system, the goal appears to have interoperability with the trust registry built between Cheqd & their partners.

And now just most recently, we'd seen IOTA & the EU take it a notch higher.

This was through the official launch of a Digital Product Passport prototype being launched.

The PoC that IOTA had been building with the EU for these past few years is really coming together.

This solution will be applied to electronics to better understand and manage lifecycles for sustainability.

In return it provides full provenance of electronics from 

• Sourcing of raw materials 
• Manufacturing of the electronic
• Distribution of products
• Use stage once purchased by retail
• Data logs on repairs & upgrades
• End of lifecycle for recycle or disposal 

Truly assigning immutable identities to electronics in a way we haven't seen before.

It's been a long time coming for IOTA's DPP work.

Time after time, it seems they continue to live up and even exceed the EU's expectations.
