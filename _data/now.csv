Jesus Diaz Vico and Christian Badertscher took a deep dive to formally analyze the security of DIDComm, a key framework in Self-Sovereign Identity systems.

Their findings? DIDComm’s encryption methods are solid but can be optimized. The team proposed an efficient alternative to improve performance by 2x and introduced a fully privacy-preserving mode to prevent recipient identifier leaks.

DIDCommの暗号技術に関する初めての正式な分析を行い、ACM CCS 2024で発表される予定です。

研究の主な成果：
・DIDCommの暗号化モデルを提示し、その仕様のセキュリティを証明しました。
・既存のモードの1つに対して、性能を2倍に向上させる改善案を提案しました。
・プライバシーを強化した新しいモードを提案しました。

DIDCommの2つの主要な暗号化モード（anoncryptとauthcrypt）とその組み合わせについて分析しました。

組み合わせモードの小さな弱点を特定し、簡単に修正可能な方法を提示しました。

新しい「ra-anon」モードを提案し、受信者の識別子を隠すことができるようになりました。これにより、SSI資格情報の受信をより匿名化できます。

提案された改善点は、JSON暗号化標準との互換性を考慮しています。

すべての詳細は、IACRのeprintで公開されている論文に記載されています。

この研究は、Self-Sovereign Identity（SSI）の分野で広く使用されているDIDCommのセキュリティと効率性を向上させる重要な貢献となっています。

I'd really like this idea to go through and become mainstream. 

I bet its going to be difficult to build something that makes everyone happy. I think the best is  to start by simple draft implementation and continue iterating by the people that come to the working groups, the feedback is always good, but i think a workin group makes more sense for this. VS everyone giving its point.
Working sessions are very structured right and should have concrete objectives, that way u organize things and don't waste too much time.

I have not checked in super depth but from my point it looks very good. Something I'd try though is getting rid of the extract methods, typescript inference is pretty nice nowadays and don't think we need it.

just like
const schema: Schema<typeof userSchema> = {}  would work as is and inference would work",,,,,,,,,,,Twitter Web App,,,,,

KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure), introduced in 2019 by PhD. Samuel M. Smith (no X account, sorry :/), offers an alternative to #DID that doesn’t require validators yet remaining decentralized and open-source—it’s compatible with #blockchain but not dependent on it.

In our latest article, @Uuuroboros  explain how #KERI works, why it overcomes #interoperability issues, and how it’s more secure and scalable. It might just redefine self-sovereign identity.

Which means even if you lose your key, you can actually rotate it and get a new one. It ties to Identity systems so if someone steals your key they can’t use it. Here is a little summary below, but my understanding, is it gained huge respect in the Identity world because it’s solved a majorly complicated problem about looking after keys?

GPT: Yes, that's correct. KERI can be integrated with various identity systems to enhance the security of key management. KERI ensures that the keys are securely managed and can be revoked or rotated if needed, while the identity system handles access to these keys. Here's a summary:

KERI + Identity Systems = Robust Security 🔐✨

KERI is a powerful key management tool that can be integrated with any identity system. It ensures your keys are secure and can be revoked or rotated if compromised. The identity system controls access, while KERI protects the keys. Perfect for safeguarding digital identities!

I know of one Blokchain that’s looking to integrate it. It’s called Cardano. 👀",,,,,,,,,,,Twitter for iPhone,,,,,

Here are some:⬇️

☑️ The W3C Verifiable Credentials standard defines how digital credentials work. 

☑️ DID Core specification establishes the structure and functionality of decentralized identifiers. 

☑️ DIDComm protocol enables secure communication between SSI agents. 

☑️ The Trust Over IP Foundation provides governance frameworks for SSI implementations. 

Furthermore, various credential exchange protocols ensure interoperability between different SSI 👥 solutions. 

Understanding these standards helps organizations implement SSI effectively. And they keep evolving to address new use cases and requirements.🔥

Privado ID addresses this challenge by following W3C standards to ensure global interoperability of decentralized identity systems:

- Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Let users create unique identifiers without permission from any authority –you can create them locally in your wallet, much like how you can create an Ethereum address

- Verifiable Credentials (VCs): Enable the private storage and content sharing of attributes about an identity (e.g. your government might issue you a verifiable credential that proves your date of birth). These credentials are stored in a standard format so that any verifier can read and understand it.

These two standards—DIDs and VCs—are key to how Privado ID operates to ensure interoperability across different platforms and apps",,,,,,,,,,,Twitter Web App,https://t.co/XdqMcQuxJt,,,,

I was, at one time, a huge advocate for XMPP because it couples identity management of a corp domain with the responsibility of content and federation. 

Atproto has some similar threads but at a personal content level. I can “take my stuff with me” if Bluesky isn’t the forever platform. Bluesky is not ATproto. 

The domain becomes the forever identity and movement of MY content to moderated platform circle of choice becomes an actual choice. 

ATproto is better than Fediverse because of identity. Everyone is searching for identity and it establishes root social content identity without some random PKI nonsense. 

I’m team ATproto even if Bluesky isn’t the app of choice to access the federation. In representation on the Internet the highest root is a domain name. Get a domain name and shove it into ATproto.",,,,,,,,,,,Twitter for iPhone,,,,,

These digital certificates contain tamper-proof 🛡️ claims about an individual's identity, qualifications, or attributes. 

For instance, a university can issue a digital diploma that students can share with employers. First, the issuer digitally signs the credential using cryptographic keys. Then, the credential is stored in the holder's digital wallet.📲

When needed, the holder can present these credentials to verifiers who can instantly confirm their authenticity.

Additionally, verifiable credentials support selective disclosure, enabling users to reveal specific information while keeping other details private.🔐

The Digital ID space is evolving quickly around global leaders & Cheqd is at the forefront of it!

• EU Blockchain Sandbox Member
• Cofounders work with Accenture Digital ID
• Founding member of Global Acceptance Network
• Recent integration with Dock Network

These are just some of the highlighted connections of Cheqd Network.

But beyond just connections they bring a very industry agnostic approach towards Digital IDs with applicable utility across some core verticals like:

• Finance/Payments
• Gaming
• Travel/Hospitality
• Retail/Commerce
• Employment/HR

At the heart of this are CHEQ tokenomics tying directly into every aspect of the network.

CHEQ is vital for payments to verifying credentials on Cheqd & doing so at a massive discount compared to traditional industry norms.

With their recent burn mechanism upgrade, this now goes beyond just identities.

Prior to this we saw ONLY ID based transactions burning CHEQ tokens, but since then it's expanded to EVERY transaction on the network burning CHEQ.

One the biggest reasons I'm so excited for the future of Cheqd is largely due to the founding members.

Fraser Edwards CEO & Ankur Banerjee CTO.

Both have had experience in the Enterprise DLT space LONG before they started Cheqd.

More specifically they had direct ties with Digital IDs at the WEF/Accenture level.

This was through the two of them both working at Accenture leading the Known Traveller Digital Identity.

The KTDI is a Digital ID framework by the WEF in 2018, with Accenture's team led by Ankur & Fraser delivering on the initial release of it.

During this time they worked with Canadian & Dutch government leaders and airlines.

On top of this Ankur had also spent time with both IDWorks and R3 with Digital Identities too!

The vision for Cheqd has been carefully crafted from experience with global leaders.

And now we're watching this plan progressively roll into action with those same global leaders🌐",,,,,,,,,,,Twitter Web App,,,,,

Problem:
Traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) systems are centralized, creating a single point of failure for digital signatures.

Solution:
Firmar bridges the gap between traditional PKI and decentralized technology, offering a legally compliant, decentralized digital signature platform.

How it Works:
Using Lit Protocol’s distributed threshold cryptography, Firmar creates a decentralized Certificate Authority, ensuring secure and decentralized signature verification. This system eliminates the vulnerabilities associated with centralized key management and sets a new standard for secure, globally compliant digital signatures.
