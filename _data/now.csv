Which means even if you lose your key, you can actually rotate it and get a new one. It ties to Identity systems so if someone steals your key they can’t use it. Here is a little summary below, but my understanding, is it gained huge respect in the Identity world because it’s solved a majorly complicated problem about looking after keys?

GPT: Yes, that's correct. KERI can be integrated with various identity systems to enhance the security of key management. KERI ensures that the keys are securely managed and can be revoked or rotated if needed, while the identity system handles access to these keys. Here's a summary:

KERI + Identity Systems = Robust Security 🔐✨

KERI is a powerful key management tool that can be integrated with any identity system. It ensures your keys are secure and can be revoked or rotated if compromised. The identity system controls access, while KERI protects the keys. Perfect for safeguarding digital identities!

According to a credible source that visited the WEF meeting in Davos, $HBAR will power the Digital Euro and integrate into the European Digital Identity wallet via W3C Verifiable Credentials.

“#EUROCOIN” will be a stable coin that is minted by European banks and backed by digital notes issued by the European Central Bank (ECB). 

According to the source, Hedera‘s Stablecoin studio will be utilised to enable the digital currency. 

A key reason behind the choice has been the record low energy consumption of the Hedera network and the possibility to tie carbon credits to transactions. 

EUROCOIN will have a KYC / AML check requirement but will settle instantaneously across EU banks.

This will likely mean that all EU banks will have to integrate Hedera’s technology. 

EUROCOIN can also be sent via SMS according to the source through Hedera council member Deutsche Telekom‘s infrastructure.",,,,,,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Giv0oABXoAADT6X.jpg,,,,,Twitter for iPhone,https://t.co/6QcHcP94CC,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Giv1N0YWoAAkwyt.jpg,https://t.co/9Oq9iogF16,,

This will not make XRPL permissioned, but permissioned elements can be added that are optional for each account holder.

It's funny to see that the whole space became used to actual real world adoption news having no Impact in the price. 

With new crypto friendly regulatory environments growing world wide this will change fundamentally. 

- #EBSI (European Block Chain Service Infrastructure) will forever be a prime example on how DLT tech and #IOTA can help to increase digitalization for countries.

- DPP (Digital Product Passports) are just about to get necessary for all critical goods in the EU and thus worldwide. #IOTA has solutions ready just for that. @Evidenlive
on the biggest software providers in the EU just announced to bring their DPP solution to #IOTA.

- DID (Digital Identities) will revolutionize they way we authenticate in the cyberspace fully regulated and distributed with no trust centralization. Think driver's license, ID, think university log in. All of that. It's ready to use on #IOTA.  @ImpierceTech and @AuvoDigital building on #IOTA to bring those solutions to governments and companies.

- TWIN (Trade Worldwide Information Network) developed with the @wef is about to revolutionize trade. Think all trade documents decentralized available on the network. No need to recheck proof on ever single border. 

- Realize will bring fully regulated and thus super secure #RWA on chain in the most modern and fastest moving Financial Market the @ADGlobalMarket. Realize is the first dApp that achieved full regulatory compliance in the ADGM. It's coming to #IOTA and #ETH.

All of that has been here for a few months. But it all changed with the likelihood of regulatory approval. 

Just think about what a single usecase is able to bring in terms of transactions per second. Now think 2, 3, 4, 5. 

And remember with #Rebase all fees getting burned. #IOTA might be deflationary way sooner than one might think. 

50 cents is peanuts.

The Digital ID space is evolving quickly around global leaders & Cheqd is at the forefront of it!

• EU Blockchain Sandbox Member
• Cofounders work with Accenture Digital ID
• Founding member of Global Acceptance Network
• Recent integration with Dock Network

These are just some of the highlighted connections of Cheqd Network.

But beyond just connections they bring a very industry agnostic approach towards Digital IDs with applicable utility across some core verticals like:

• Finance/Payments
• Gaming
• Travel/Hospitality
• Retail/Commerce
• Employment/HR

At the heart of this are CHEQ tokenomics tying directly into every aspect of the network.

CHEQ is vital for payments to verifying credentials on Cheqd & doing so at a massive discount compared to traditional industry norms.

With their recent burn mechanism upgrade, this now goes beyond just identities.

Prior to this we saw ONLY ID based transactions burning CHEQ tokens, but since then it's expanded to EVERY transaction on the network burning CHEQ.

One the biggest reasons I'm so excited for the future of Cheqd is largely due to the founding members.

Fraser Edwards CEO & Ankur Banerjee CTO.

Both have had experience in the Enterprise DLT space LONG before they started Cheqd.

More specifically they had direct ties with Digital IDs at the WEF/Accenture level.

This was through the two of them both working at Accenture leading the Known Traveller Digital Identity.

The KTDI is a Digital ID framework by the WEF in 2018, with Accenture's team led by Ankur & Fraser delivering on the initial release of it.

During this time they worked with Canadian & Dutch government leaders and airlines.

On top of this Ankur had also spent time with both IDWorks and R3 with Digital Identities too!

The vision for Cheqd has been carefully crafted from experience with global leaders.

And now we're watching this plan progressively roll into action with those same global leaders🌐",,,,,,,,,,,Twitter Web App,,,,,

WISeKey’s PKI and #Quantum Root of Trust establish a verifiable identity layer that eliminates phishing, impersonation, and unauthorized access. By combining this with SEALCOIN, which functions as a cryptographically secured transaction mechanism tied to digital identities, the risk of fraud in decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and tokenized assets is mitigated.

Hedera Hashgraph’s asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) consensus ensures immutability and security at scale while providing high-speed, low-latency transaction finality. Unlike traditional blockchains, Hashgraph prevents forks and 51% attacks through its gossip-about-gossip protocol and virtual voting, making it an ideal distributed ledger for Web 3.0 applications requiring deterministic security.

The integration of WISeKey’s post-quantum cryptographic technologies further future-proofs Web 3.0 security by securing wallets, transactions, and IoT devices against quantum-based attacks. Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) embedded in IoT devices ensure cryptographic key protection, while SEALCOIN’s integration with these secure enclaves ensures trusted transactions across decentralized networks.

By leveraging WISeKey’s identity infrastructure, SEALCOIN’s verifiable transactions, and Hedera’s high-assurance ledger, Web 3.0 ecosystems can establish a quantum-resistant, fraud-proof, and scalable cybersecurity foundation. This architecture not only secures identity-linked transactions but also ensures compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR, eliminating central points of failure while enabling trustless authentication across metaverse applications, decentralized applications (dApps), and next-generation AI-driven digital ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,,,Twitter for iPhone,https://t.co/t4LP8znw6f,https://t.co/1VxJ9bWggW,,,

In Verifiable Credentials #VC and Verifiable Presentations #VP, PQC needs to have (1) short signature verification time first and foremost, (2) short signature generation time, (3) small signature size, and (4) small public key size.  ML-DSA-44 (Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm), ML-DSA-65, and ML-DSA-87 fit these requirements.  

PQ/T (Post-Quantum and Traditional) hybrid cryptographic schemes combine both PQC and traditional signature algorithms, and it is secure as long as one of the algorithms holds.  One of the ways to combine signature schemes is the concatenation combiner that archives the weak non-separability #WNS property.

Christopher started with a brief history on cryptography, the traditional single-signature paradigm, and the pitfalls of such single-signature paradigm. #Identity is about relationships, so he proposes “relational edge identity” using Schnorr signature to model these identity relationships. Instead of a public key representing an entity, we would have a cryptographic clique identifier (i.e. a group public key) that represents a group of relationship edges composing the identity. Such clique identifiers empower decentralized identity management, peer-based identity authentication, SPOC/SPOF resilience, secret group decision making, and enhanced privacy.

Understanding DIDComm

If you are reading this, you probably know already what Decentralized Identifiers (DID) are: they are “identifiers” or addresses which can be queried to return some information about the subject represented. The addresses take the form of a long, opaque “string” (a long block of letters and numbers, in this case of a fixed length), and the DID “documents” that get returned when they are queried contain some cryptographic key material and, depending on the particularities of the returning system, maybe a few other pieces of information or addresses.
