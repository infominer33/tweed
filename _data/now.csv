Previously, if your credentials needed to be updated, you couldn’t easily do it. You'd have to manually refresh them

To improve updates in credentials, the W3C introduced the Verifiable Credentials standard:
👉 https://t.co/dYA1gwkU61

Until now, no one had implemented this method, but Polygon ID is the first to deliver a solution. Now, your credentials can stay up-to-date without the hassle!

For Business: Use-Cases & Benefits
Credential providers can now create new business models by offering credentials that need to be updated frequently:

• Dynamic Data: easily update credentials that change frequently, such as credit scores
• Truly compliant KYC/AML: implement a seamless KYC/AML verification process, creating short lived credentials and checking on each update
• Refresh Paid services: charging for updating credentials, such as renewing your driver license

For Devs: Refresh Service⚠️
With our refresh service, expired credentials are automatically updated from the user's wallet!

Dynamic credentials keep user information up-to-date. Now, users can either refresh their credentials themselves when they expire or have them automatically refreshed during verification, if required

This implementation of Dynamics Credentials involves adding a new service to the issuer's system and using a refresh protocol in mobile apps and JavaScript SDKs
