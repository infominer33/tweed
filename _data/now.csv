The speed at which they absorb new techniques and research is pretty impressive. Yes, I think most of these startups esp in AI infra will get wiped out. It doesn't matter we need the experimentation and velocity to define a bunch of new seamless infra for next 5-10 years.

We still live in a world of devops/ITOps complexity. Think about standing up a k8s (I still believe this is an Alphabet psyop to destroy productivity) cluster. The amount of effort it takes it get simple things running is a ridiculous. If something goes wrong good luck. Seems like a prime spot for folks to build tooling to auto-wire, debug etc. Describe what you want and have the system build a template. Then have another system interrogate what was built and point out how insecure it is and fix it. A third system to deploy and test.

There are infinite variations of this where AI systems can be useful. Acceleration + Leverage are the key things here. Let people do things faster and let people downstream take control of their own problems and let AI systems do they heavy lifting. There's a whole bunch of corporate middle-persons you can cut out.

We're going to cap out on vector stores, agent composers, model training + finetuning etc.  People work on these because it is super low hanging fruit to build systems. The market will consolidate around 2-5 projects and the rest will go to zero or close to it. Do I think people should stop working these problems? No, it's great to have people trying and building. It beats working for a big company. I just consider it UBI via investors to help people try things out which is fine by me.

Vertical apps where you have your own model + dataset  + domain is going to be where some category defining companies get created in the next 1-3 years. This is much harder since each element requires some expertise. I think of OAI wrapper companies as the mid-ground where you can build decent cash flow businesses but the rate at which they get copied will be high. Incumbents can also just see what works and fast follow if a company is just a wrapper with no particular defense around dataset or domain knowledge.",https://foundationcapital.com/top-takeaways-from-our-generative-ai-unconference/,,,,,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fy2wVk2aIAAFDx1?format=png&name=orig,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fy2ybevaAAAKF_g?format=png&name=orig,,,
