I'd really like this idea to go through and become mainstream. 

I bet its going to be difficult to build something that makes everyone happy. I think the best is  to start by simple draft implementation and continue iterating by the people that come to the working groups, the feedback is always good, but i think a workin group makes more sense for this. VS everyone giving its point.
Working sessions are very structured right and should have concrete objectives, that way u organize things and don't waste too much time.

I have not checked in super depth but from my point it looks very good. Something I'd try though is getting rid of the extract methods, typescript inference is pretty nice nowadays and don't think we need it.

just like
const schema: Schema<typeof userSchema> = {}  would work as is and inference would work",,,,,,,,,,,Twitter Web App

Which means even if you lose your key, you can actually rotate it and get a new one. It ties to Identity systems so if someone steals your key they can’t use it. Here is a little summary below, but my understanding, is it gained huge respect in the Identity world because it’s solved a majorly complicated problem about looking after keys?

GPT: Yes, that's correct. KERI can be integrated with various identity systems to enhance the security of key management. KERI ensures that the keys are securely managed and can be revoked or rotated if needed, while the identity system handles access to these keys. Here's a summary:

KERI + Identity Systems = Robust Security 🔐✨

KERI is a powerful key management tool that can be integrated with any identity system. It ensures your keys are secure and can be revoked or rotated if compromised. The identity system controls access, while KERI protects the keys. Perfect for safeguarding digital identities!

I know of one Blokchain that’s looking to integrate it. It’s called Cardano. 👀",,,,,,,,,,,Twitter for iPhone

Think of Saito as a decentralized PKI. PKI underpins ALL security on the internet, so Saito is making the security of any app online available without trusted CAs.

Biometrics & TPMs (TEE, Secure Enclave) mean we have HSM roots of trust almost everywhere. 

New decentralized zero knowledge protocols can now skip PKI asymmetric keys, using only PQC symmetric keys for every session or trusted execution:

No house required.

 It exists on Saito, but without a trusted middleman to verify public keys. Decentralized PKI built for affordable, global scale.

Poker is just the beginning.
