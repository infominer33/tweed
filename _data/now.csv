What is #W3C ? - The World Wide Web Consortium, abbreviated as #W3C, is a non-profit standards organization founded in October 1994 to promote the compatibility of World Wide Web technologies such as HTML5, HTML, XHTML, XML, RDF, SPARQL, CSS, XSL, PNG, SVG, MathML and SOAP. Operating as an international consortium, it has 452 members as of October 1, 20211.

#W3C was founded by Tim Berners-Lee after he left #CERN in October 1994. #W3C was founded at MIT/LCS (Massachusetts Institute of Technology / Laboratory for Computer Science) with the support of the US defense agency #DARPA. Expanse founder Tim Junio worked for the #CIA and the secretary of defense before meeting co-founder Matt Kraning at #DARPA, the US defense agency that incubates technology projects. https://t.co/wM2PFT0toK

#PeterThiel‚Äôs big data analytics company, Expanse is one of a growing number of private startups that power America‚Äôs most important government agencies and its biggest businesses (Thiel‚Äôs Founder‚Äôs Fund is a major investor in Expanse). Expanse‚Äôs private clients include Thiel-founded #PayPal, pharma behemoth Allergan, and legal giant Orrick. Expanse also has contracts with the Department of Defense, the Army, and the Navy. https://t.co/r5tGHmfd8y

#Ripple has also received investment from the early-stage wing the Founder‚Äôs Fund, a venture firm owned by PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel. https://t.co/ZcDU9SPQmG

List of participant members - https://t.co/hfRWPxfowm

#W3C use a #Ripple protocol ! #Interledger Project - Invented at #Ripple, developed as a standalone open project https://t.co/BSkjmowrfN

Stefan is developing the Interledger Protocol (#ILP), an open source standard for connecting payment networks. Stefan recently worked with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and other partners to develop #Mojaloop, an open source, #ILP-enabled national payment switch that connects mobile wallets in developing markets. Stefan also sits on the board of the JS Foundation.

Stefan produced the popular ‚ÄúWhat is #Bitcoin?‚Äù video, which introduced millions of users to #Bitcoin. He also created the first #Bitcoin implementation in JavaScript (#BitcoinJS), which is used by hundreds of blockchain companies of all sizes today. https://t.co/pxIUO2EGV0

#ILP will also enhance the reach and impact of the #Ripple Consensus Ledger (RCL), which serves as the root ledger for the digital currency #XRP. Digital currencies continue to play a critical role in the burgeoning Internet of Value. As always, our focus is to make #XRP the best bridge asset for market makers providing cross-currency #liquidity. https://t.co/kHHHE7kPxj

The Atomic mode of the protocol provides atomicity for payment chains in which the participants can agree upon a group of notaries. The Universal mode uses the incentives of rational actors to enable practical payments between participants that do not all share trust in any institution or system.

#ILP does not rely on any single system for processing payments, so there is NO LIMIT to its #scalability. Payments can be as #fast and #cheap as the constituent ledgers and connectors allow and transaction details are private to their participants.

Connectors can be composed to make payments and the financial system more accessible, competitive and resilient. This enables the creation of a global graph of LIQUIDITY or #Interledger https://t.co/EwMHz9Nsro

LIQUIDITY LIQUDITY LIQUDITY. Everything thet #Ripple builds is for the LIQUIDITY. 

Everything that #Ripple put in place is universal, for every blockchain, every financial institutions, for every bank, for every network etc...

#XRP will be a dominant asset, because #Ripple is creating a spider's web. Everything will be connected. 

Know what you hold. #Ripple knows everything because they are behind everything!
