Which means even if you lose your key, you can actually rotate it and get a new one. It ties to Identity systems so if someone steals your key they can‚Äôt use it. Here is a little summary below, but my understanding, is it gained huge respect in the Identity world because it‚Äôs solved a majorly complicated problem about looking after keys?

GPT: Yes, that's correct. KERI can be integrated with various identity systems to enhance the security of key management. KERI ensures that the keys are securely managed and can be revoked or rotated if needed, while the identity system handles access to these keys. Here's a summary:

KERI + Identity Systems = Robust Security üîê‚ú®

KERI is a powerful key management tool that can be integrated with any identity system. It ensures your keys are secure and can be revoked or rotated if compromised. The identity system controls access, while KERI protects the keys. Perfect for safeguarding digital identities!

It's funny to see that the whole space became used to actual real world adoption news having no Impact in the price. 

With new crypto friendly regulatory environments growing world wide this will change fundamentally. 

- #EBSI (European Block Chain Service Infrastructure) will forever be a prime example on how DLT tech and #IOTA can help to increase digitalization for countries.

- DPP (Digital Product Passports) are just about to get necessary for all critical goods in the EU and thus worldwide. #IOTA has solutions ready just for that. @Evidenlive
on the biggest software providers in the EU just announced to bring their DPP solution to #IOTA.

- DID (Digital Identities) will revolutionize they way we authenticate in the cyberspace fully regulated and distributed with no trust centralization. Think driver's license, ID, think university log in. All of that. It's ready to use on #IOTA.  @ImpierceTech and @AuvoDigital building on #IOTA to bring those solutions to governments and companies.

- TWIN (Trade Worldwide Information Network) developed with the @wef is about to revolutionize trade. Think all trade documents decentralized available on the network. No need to recheck proof on ever single border. 

- Realize will bring fully regulated and thus super secure #RWA on chain in the most modern and fastest moving Financial Market the @ADGlobalMarket. Realize is the first dApp that achieved full regulatory compliance in the ADGM. It's coming to #IOTA and #ETH.

All of that has been here for a few months. But it all changed with the likelihood of regulatory approval. 

Just think about what a single usecase is able to bring in terms of transactions per second. Now think 2, 3, 4, 5. 

And remember with #Rebase all fees getting burned. #IOTA might be deflationary way sooner than one might think. 

50 cents is peanuts.

The Digital ID space is evolving quickly around global leaders & Cheqd is at the forefront of it!

‚Ä¢ EU Blockchain Sandbox Member
‚Ä¢ Cofounders work with Accenture Digital ID
‚Ä¢ Founding member of Global Acceptance Network
‚Ä¢ Recent integration with Dock Network

These are just some of the highlighted connections of Cheqd Network.

But beyond just connections they bring a very industry agnostic approach towards Digital IDs with applicable utility across some core verticals like:

‚Ä¢ Finance/Payments
‚Ä¢ Gaming
‚Ä¢ Travel/Hospitality
‚Ä¢ Retail/Commerce
‚Ä¢ Employment/HR

At the heart of this are CHEQ tokenomics tying directly into every aspect of the network.

CHEQ is vital for payments to verifying credentials on Cheqd & doing so at a massive discount compared to traditional industry norms.

With their recent burn mechanism upgrade, this now goes beyond just identities.

Prior to this we saw ONLY ID based transactions burning CHEQ tokens, but since then it's expanded to EVERY transaction on the network burning CHEQ.

One the biggest reasons I'm so excited for the future of Cheqd is largely due to the founding members.

Fraser Edwards CEO & Ankur Banerjee CTO.

Both have had experience in the Enterprise DLT space LONG before they started Cheqd.

More specifically they had direct ties with Digital IDs at the WEF/Accenture level.

This was through the two of them both working at Accenture leading the Known Traveller Digital Identity.

The KTDI is a Digital ID framework by the WEF in 2018, with Accenture's team led by Ankur & Fraser delivering on the initial release of it.

During this time they worked with Canadian & Dutch government leaders and airlines.

On top of this Ankur had also spent time with both IDWorks and R3 with Digital Identities too!

The vision for Cheqd has been carefully crafted from experience with global leaders.

And now we're watching this plan progressively roll into action with those same global leadersüåê",,,,,,,,,,,Twitter Web App,,,,,

Solution:
Firmar bridges the gap between traditional PKI and decentralized technology, offering a legally compliant, decentralized digital signature platform.

Using Lit Protocol‚Äôs distributed threshold cryptography, Firmar creates a decentralized Certificate Authority, ensuring secure and decentralized signature verification.

Quantum computers will break most of the cryptographies used today, so we will need to develop post-quantum cryptography #PQC, along with cryptographic agility and pliability, to future-proof security.  

In Verifiable Credentials #VC and Verifiable Presentations #VP, PQC needs to have (1) short signature verification time first and foremost, (2) short signature generation time, (3) small signature size, and (4) small public key size.  ML-DSA-44 (Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm), ML-DSA-65, and ML-DSA-87 fit these requirements.  

PQ/T (Post-Quantum and Traditional) hybrid cryptographic schemes combine both PQC and traditional signature algorithms, and it is secure as long as one of the algorithms holds.  One of the ways to combine signature schemes is the concatenation combiner that archives the weak non-separability #WNS property.

He first talked about leveraging the challenge (i.e. one-time random number) to prevent replay attacks between verifier and holder, and then he explained the public-key-based holder binding and its pros and cons.  To get to anonymous holder binding, he explained how the commitment scheme and zero-knowledge proof work in detail, giving an example of how Signal implements its zero-knowledge usernames.

If you are reading this, you probably know already what Decentralized Identifiers (DID) are: they are ‚Äúidentifiers‚Äù or addresses which can be queried to return some information about the subject represented. The addresses take the form of a long, opaque ‚Äústring‚Äù (a long block of letters and numbers, in this case of a fixed length), and the DID ‚Äúdocuments‚Äù that get returned when they are queried contain some cryptographic key material and, depending on the particularities of the returning system, maybe a few other pieces of information or addresses.
