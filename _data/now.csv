ETHG features a built-in smart contract module package, bridging external service modules (like RPC) and underlying infrastructure modules (such as network, storage, and account modules). Other modules like storage, basic encryption algorithms, and network provide foundational support to smart contracts. Smart contracts are defined by upper-layer applications, interpreted by interpreters, stored by storage modules, and executed by the ETHG smart contract module package. The ETHG smart contract interpreter supports multiple high-level programming languages, allowing developers to design smart contracts using their preferred language. 💡💻

In addition to supporting Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Smart Contracts, ETHG also embraces the latest Layer2 technology.

It gained notoriety after Arthur Conan Doyle (yes, the creator of Sherlock) gave them credibility as ""real evidence"" of the existence of fairies.

As generative AI image/video/audio becomes more popular, more life-like, and cheaper to produce, we're in for a reckoning on what we can trust that's shared online. Especially in a year when 65+ countries around the world are holding elections. I'm almost certain that deepfakes (unfortunately) are going to sway at least one of these elections, and people will really start paying attention to what's human-generated vs not.

So while the decentralized identity space has traditionally focussed a lot on making digital replicas of paper/plastic documents, making KYC easier etc, IMO one of the sleeping giants of use cases that will accelerate the adoption of decentralised identity is the concept of ""Content Credentials"", which provide a chain-of-custody on what edits happened to image, and whether it's AI-generated or not.

Editing in itself is not a ""bad thing"", since there are a lot of legitimate reasons to edit a photo (maybe you want to crop it, or fix blemishes). And whether an audio-visual is AI-generated or not is not binary, since you could have a real actor on an AI-generated background.

Read more to dive deeper into how @cheqd_io's tech - among many other interoperable industry solutions. -can be applied to this emerging space of Content Credentials 👇🏾",,,,,,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GMGbKPcWIAA87t2.png,,,,,Twitter Web App

The progress in the past few months been HUGE for Enterprise DLT.

From establishing in Abu Dhabi to building trade solutions in Africa with WEF.

They're one to watch for the long term.

The network architectures quite unique in itself through the Tangle's ability for transactions to verify other transactions on the network.

Simply put, each transaction validates 2 other transactions that are sent.

Thus creating an endless chain of trust.

As the only way for your transaction to go through is by verifying the 2 other transactions in the chain.

The biggest benefit to this model is that it's feeless & provides a Network Effect where the more transactions are submitted, the more transactions are verified by one another.

In terms of use and adoption, we've seen IOTA connect with government entities & F500s alike.

What's most interesting is how they've worked with 3 governments in 3 different jurisdictions.

90% of DLTs struggle with ANY form of government adoption on the network at all.

Yet IOTA's captured 3 different ones:

UAE: IOTA Foundation regulated by ADGM and given green light to operate in UAE to collaborate on trade innovations in the region.

Africa: TLIP is built by Trademark Africa & WEF on IOTA. TM Africa is also funded by 8+ G20 nations along with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

EU: IOTA is one of few names that have made it to the final testing phase of the EBSI's test for blockchain in commercial use before live production.

To top it off, they're also a founding member of INATBA & contributors to some of the core working groups.

As we know INATBA is the bridge between private and public DLT innovations for regulators and builders, which is especially apparent in EU regions.

Along with this we've also seen private sector involvement from huge names in the world of tech and institutional digital assets.

Dell: Building real time carbon footprint solution
IBM: References IOTA in M2M comm patent
Fireblocks: ShimmerEVM for tokenized assets

In fact, last week we saw the newly launched IOTA Foundation in Abu Dhabi allocate $10 Mil to accelerate tokenization & digital trade innovations on IOTA!
